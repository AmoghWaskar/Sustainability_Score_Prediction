# Sustainability_Score_Prediction
A Streamlit-based ML application for sustainability score prediction using environmental indicators.
With rapid urbanization, evaluating sustainability at the locality level has become essential. This project leverages **machine learning** to analyze factors such as energy usage, water consumption, waste generation, green cover, and public transport accessibility to predict a **Sustainability Score (0–100)**.

The application enables real-time predictions, explains model behavior using feature importance, and allows scenario simulations to understand how sustainability can be improved.

I have generated the dummy data using generate_data() function which is in app.py itself.
